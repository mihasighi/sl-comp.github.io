## Welcome to SL-COMP Pages

   SL-COMP is an initiative for collecting decision problems in [Separation Logic](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/SeparationLogic/Separation_Logic/SL_Home.html)
   and solvers dealing with such problems.

   This initiative started in 2014 and it was inspired by the very
   popular initiatives on other theories, like
   first-order theories for [SMT-COMP](http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net) and
   Boolean constraints for [SAT-COMP](http://www.satcompetition.org).
