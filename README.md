The Separation Logic Competition (SL-COMP) is an initiative to bring together 
researchers and practitioners interested on improving the state of the art of 
automated deduction methods for 
[Separation Logic](http://www0.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/p.ohearn/SeparationLogic/Separation_Logic/SL_Home.html).
The competition is run on more than 1K decision problems for different theories 
of Separation Logic. The solvers are compared on each theory on the number
of problems solved and the running time. 
This initiative started at [FLOC 2014](http://vsl2014.at/) and 
it has been afiliated with different events: 
[SMT-COMP 2014](http://smtcomp.sourceforge.net/2014/), 
[FLOC 2018](https://www.floc18.org) workshop
[ADSL 2018](http://adsl.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/) and 
[TOOLympics 2019](https://tacas.info/toolympics.php).
